# WEB3-TWITTER

A more decentralised version of Twitter , relied only in smart contracts and IPFS

## General Overviiew

The internet is fastly transitining to new technologies , that's why I decided to build the ultimate Twitter
version , with the  ultimate Web3 stack : 

1. Solidity
2. IPFS
3. Tailwind.css
4. Next.js

### Profile Creation

The dapp allows us to store our whole profile in a decentralised way :
    - Strings data is stored in the contact
    - Images are stored in IPFS
